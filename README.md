# Keyboard notes

## Details

This board was purchased in the 3rd round GroupBuy, which uses the V2 PCB.  

> V2 PCBs were only used in the 3rd GB round (R3). To confirm which version you need, remove the bottom from the keyboard and look beside the Corne-ish Zen logo for a version number. Group Buy rounds 1 and 2 have V1 PCBs and R3 has V2 PCBs. (Also V2 PCBs have white power switches... V1 PCBs have black ones.)

A lot of this repo is a fork from the main repo (as instructed) [here](https://github.com/LOWPROKB/zmk-config-Zen-2)
